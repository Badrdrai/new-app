A full-stack application built with NestJS, React, and PostgreSQL.
The user fills a form with their personal information, and the system saves the data into the PostgreSQL database.
After saving, the backend automatically generates a unique QR code for that user.
When someone searches by the user's name, the application retrieves the stored data and displays the related QR code.
If the QR code is scanned, it shows all the user’s information encoded inside that QR code
